# Simple AWS EC2 Instance Control

This app makes it easy to start and stop non-production EC2 instances when they are unsed intermittently for testing and validation. 

Installation:
- `pip3 install boto3`
- `pip3 install customtkinter`
- Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS access key ID and secret key
